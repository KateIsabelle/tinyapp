# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

!["When a user is logged in, the home page displays a list of their personal Tiny URLs, which they can edit and delete with buttons, or add to through the 'Create New URL' link in the header"](https://github.com/KateIsabelle/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/my-url-page.png?raw=true)
!["When a new Tiny URL is created, or an existing URL is edited: Click the Short URL link to be redirected to the long URL, or Edit to change which long URL the Tiny one points to"](https://github.com/KateIsabelle/tinyapp/blob/master/docs/urls-new-edit.png?raw=true)
